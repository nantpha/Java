### Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Setup Environment

1. **Install Python and Necessary Libraries**
   ```bash
   pip install transformers torch tensorflow pandas numpy requests jinja2 spacy
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   ```

#### Step 2: Define the Test Case Structure

```python
test_case_template = {
    "Test Case ID": "TC001",
    "Test Description": "",
    "Preconditions": "",
    "Test Steps": "",
    "Expected Result": "",
    "Actual Result": "",
    "Status": ""
}
```

#### Step 3: Fetch Requirements

Example of fetching requirements from a JSON file or an API (e.g., Jira):

```python
import requests

def fetch_requirements_from_api(api_url, headers):
    response = requests.get(api_url, headers=headers)
    return response.json()

# Example API call to fetch requirements
api_url = 'https://your-jira-instance/api/issues'
headers = {'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN'}
requirements = fetch_requirements_from_api(api_url, headers)
```

#### Step 4: Fine-tune a Transformer Model

Use Hugging Face's Transformers library to fine-tune a model like BERT, GPT-2, or T5.

```python
from transformers import T5ForConditionalGeneration, T5Tokenizer

model_name = "t5-small"
tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Example of fine-tuning the model (simplified)
def fine_tune_model(train_data):
    # Fine-tuning code here, using train_data
    pass

# Load training data (requirements and existing test cases)
train_data = [...]  # List of (requirement, test_case) pairs
fine_tune_model(train_data)
```

#### Step 5: Generate Test Cases using the Fine-tuned Model

```python
def generate_test_case(requirement):
    input_text = f"generate test cases: {requirement}"
    input_ids = tokenizer.encode(input_text, return_tensors='pt')
    outputs = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=150)
    test_case_text = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    return test_case_text

requirement = "The system should allow users to reset their password using their registered email address."
test_steps = generate_test_case(requirement)

test_case = test_case_template.copy()
test_case["Test Description"] = "Verify password reset functionality"
test_case["Preconditions"] = "User is registered and has a valid email address"
test_case["Test Steps"] = test_steps
test_case["Expected Result"] = "User should receive a password reset link and be able to reset their password"

print(test_case)
```

#### Step 6: Store Generated Test Cases

```python
import pandas as pd

# Example of storing test cases in a CSV file
def store_test_cases_in_csv(test_cases, filename='test_cases.csv'):
    df = pd.DataFrame(test_cases)
    df.to_csv(filename, index=False)

store_test_cases_in_csv([test_case])
```

#### Step 7: Automate the Process

Use a tool like Jenkins or GitHub Actions to automate the process of fetching requirements and generating test cases:

- **Jenkins**: Set up a job to run the Python script at regular intervals or on code commits.
- **GitHub Actions**: Create a workflow to run the script on specific triggers.

#### Example GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
name: Generate Test Cases

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  generate-test-cases:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: '3.x'

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install transformers torch tensorflow pandas numpy requests jinja2 spacy
          python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

      - name: Run Test Case Generation Script
        run: |
          python generate_test_cases.py
```

This tech stack and workflow outline should help you build an automated system for generating test cases using AI and Python without relying on OpenAI. Adapt and expand upon these steps to fit your specific requirements and environment.

*****************************************

Creating a system for automatic test case generation using AI and Python involves several steps, including defining the test case structure, leveraging AI to generate meaningful test cases, and ensuring that these test cases are relevant and useful. Here's a high-level design for such a system:

### 1. Define Test Case Structure
A standard test case structure typically includes:
- Test Case ID
- Test Description
- Preconditions
- Test Steps
- Expected Result
- Actual Result (to be filled after execution)
- Status (Pass/Fail, to be filled after execution)

### 2. Requirements Collection
Gather the requirements or the specifications of the application under test (AUT). This can be done by:
- Parsing requirements documents.
- Extracting information from user stories or use cases in agile boards (like Jira).
- Analyzing code comments or documentation.

### 3. AI Model Selection
Choose an AI model suitable for generating text, such as OpenAI's GPT model. Fine-tune the model using a dataset of existing test cases and requirements.

### 4. Data Preparation
Prepare the data for training and validation:
- Collect a dataset of existing test cases and their corresponding requirements.
- Clean and preprocess the data to ensure consistency and quality.

### 5. Model Training and Fine-Tuning
Fine-tune the chosen AI model on the prepared dataset:
- Train the model to understand the relationship between requirements and test cases.
- Validate and test the model to ensure it generates accurate and relevant test cases.

### 6. Test Case Generation
Implement a system to generate test cases using the fine-tuned model. The system should:
- Accept requirements as input.
- Use the AI model to generate test cases.
- Format the generated test cases into the predefined structure.

### 7. Integration and Automation
Integrate the test case generation system into the development workflow:
- Automate the generation process using scripts and tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions.
- Ensure the generated test cases are stored in a test management tool (like TestRail or Jira) or a version control system.

### 8. Validation and Feedback Loop
Implement a feedback loop to continuously improve the model:
- Validate the generated test cases by running them and comparing the results with expected outcomes.
- Collect feedback from testers and developers to refine the model.

### Example Implementation in Python

Here's a simplified example to illustrate the process using Python and OpenAI's GPT-3 model:

```python
import openai

# Set up your OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'

def generate_test_case(requirement):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",  # Use the appropriate model
        prompt=f"Generate test cases for the following requirement:\n{requirement}",
        max_tokens=150
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Example requirement
requirement = "The system should allow users to reset their password using their registered email address."

# Generate test case
test_case = generate_test_case(requirement)
print(test_case)

# Example output formatting (simplified)
test_case_template = {
    "Test Case ID": "TC001",
    "Test Description": "Verify password reset functionality",
    "Preconditions": "User is registered and has a valid email address",
    "Test Steps": test_case,
    "Expected Result": "User should receive a password reset link and be able to reset their password",
    "Actual Result": "",
    "Status": ""
}

print(test_case_template)
```

### 9. Enhance and Scale
To enhance and scale the system:
- Implement more sophisticated NLP techniques for better requirement understanding.
- Utilize domain-specific models if necessary.
- Continuously update the training data with new test cases and requirements.
- Implement a user interface for easy interaction with the system.

This design provides a starting point for creating an AI-powered test case generation system using Python. It involves a combination of data preparation, AI model training, and integration into the development workflow to automate and streamline the testing process.
